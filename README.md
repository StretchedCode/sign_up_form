# sign_up_form
Simple Web project involving HTML CSS and client-side form validation

### Update: Project Finished
I feel as if this project was much easier, despite being more complex then my pilot project, why? Well, this time around I was able to fully layout the dewsign of the website beforehand, reducing the amount of time needed fine-tuning values. Some hard-coding was still necessary, but much less so then my other projects. 9/10
